## About the Video Course
	Java developers like you wish to build dynamic enterprise applications and Spring 5 helps you architect applications with a modular and integral approach. This course will help you understand architecturally significant demands while building enterprise applications and see how to determine them. You’ll also get a complete understanding of the different architectural quality requirements that will help you build a product that satisfies business needs, such as maintainability, testability, scalability, performance, usability, and security.
You’ll start by learning about the quality architectural requirements of Spring 5 software design. Next, you’ll understand the Spring database architecture and how it helps you architect a NoSQL database in your enterprise applications. Moving on, you’ll find out about Microservices Architecture and its practical usage in enterprise application development. Further on, you’ll learn how Spring provides Cloud Deployment and how DevOps Integration works. Lastly, you’ll see practically how Spring 5 provides utilities in its architecture to perform Unit and Integration Testing and provides both authentication and authorization to enable security.
By the end of this course, you’ll be able to acknowledge Spring 5 and its architectural quality requirements to help design an efficient enterprise and web application that satisfies growing business needs.
